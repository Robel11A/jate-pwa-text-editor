# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description

Just Another Text Editor (JATE) is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that functions as a versatile text editor. The application is designed to work seamlessly both online and offline, making it a reliable tool for creating and saving notes, code snippets, or any other text content. JATE utilizes multiple data persistence methods, ensuring that your content is saved even if one storage option is not supported by the browser.

The application leverages modern web technologies, including IndexedDB for client-side storage, service workers for offline functionality, and Webpack for bundling assets. It can be installed directly on your device, allowing you to access it as a native application.
